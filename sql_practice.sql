-- HackerRank Weather Station Challenge

SELECT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE ID % 2 = 0
GROUP BY CITY;

-- Weather station #4 challenge
SELECT (COUNT(CITY) - COUNT(DISTINCT CITY))
FROM STATION;

-- Point of this above exercise was to show how to do simple math in the SELECT command, and to utilize DISTINCT.

-- HackerRank SQL #5:

SELECT CITY AS c, LENGTH(CITY) AS l
FROM STATION
ORDER BY l DESC, c DESC
LIMIT 1;

SELECT CITY AS c, LENGTH(CITY) AS l
FROM STATION
ORDER BY l ASC, c ASC
LIMIT 1;



-- Query the list of CITY names starting with vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, or u) from STATION. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE lower(substring(CITY, 1, 1)) IN ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u');

-- Finding cities with the last letter being a vowel, requires one simple difference since I'm using the substring function. Nice!

SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE lower(substring(CITY, -1, 1)) IN ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u');

-- Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not start with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE LOWER(SUBSTRING(CITY, 1, 1)) NOT IN ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u');


-- Finding The city names that don't end with a vowel:


SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE LOWER(SUBSTRING(CITY, -1, 1)) NOT IN ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u');

-- Query the list of CITY names from STATION that either do not start with vowels or do not end with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE LOWER(SUBSTRING(CITY, 1, 1)) NOT IN ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')
OR LOWER(SUBSTRING(CITY, -1, 1)) NOT IN ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u');
